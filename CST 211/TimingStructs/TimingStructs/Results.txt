3.    Short observations on what you have observed and learned.

Arrays are faster than other "linear" structs if you know what size to make them in advance.
(Use a list otherwise)
BSTrees kinda suck? AVL Trees seem to be automatically superior.
Hash Tables are very fast for data retrival, but slow to populate.
