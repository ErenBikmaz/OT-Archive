Assignment 16
Timing Experiments

Description

After running Assignment 15 on your hard drive, you should have a data file full of paths and filenames. 
If you did not complete the lab borrow someone else’s output file to complete this lab. Write a program 
that inserts all of the data from the file into the following data structures you wrote.

1.    Array
2.    Linked List
3.    Binary Search Tree
4.    AVL Tree
5.    Hash Table


I want you to time all of the insertions and a search on each individual data structure. Include in your lab 
submission a small document that indicates

1.    The time it took to do all of the insertions broken out by each data structure.
2.    The time it took to do the search broken out by each data structure.
3.    Short observations on what you have observed and learned.
