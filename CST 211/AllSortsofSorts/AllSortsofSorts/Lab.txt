Assignment 14
Sorts

Description

1.   
Write the following sorts:

Brute Force Bubble, 
Flagged Bubble, 
Selection, 
Insertion, 
Shell, 
Heap (iterative),
Merge (recursive), 
and Quick (recursive).

2.   
Use command line arguments to get the total 
number of records to sort. This will 
become n.

3.   
Create and randomly fill an array with integers. 
Use this same array of data for each sorting algorithm. 
Make sure to reset the array(s) back to the original 
data after each sort so that you are comparing the 
algorithms on the same data set.

4.   
Measure the time it takes, using chrono, for each sort
to complete its sorting routine. Write the sort name 
and the time it took to complete to the screen as well 
as a file. Print every 1000th element to the output file
so it is easier to see that the sort worked.

5.   
Use C-Arrays (native arrays), vector class, and your 
array class as containers. Run the 
program and store the results in a text file in the solution.
