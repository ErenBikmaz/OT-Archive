Description

Create a program that will traverse the directory structure of the hard drive and store all directory 
and file names into a data structure. 

You should accept the starting directory via command line 
arguments.

Provide the functionality to manipulate your data structure:
1.    
Find everything that meets a specific pattern. For example, “*.docx” will show all files with that 
extension. 
The following are examples: VIA COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS
	a.
	list c:\test – will show all files in that directory only
	b.    
	list c:\test\*.docx – will show all docx files in that directory
	c.
	list -r c:\test\*.docx  - will show all docx in that directory and all subdirectories
	d.    
	list code – will show any directory or file that has the string “code” in the name starting 
	at the top of the data structure.
2.    
Write the data to file. This data will be used in the next assignment. Write the drive, path and if 
	appropriate filename to the output file.
