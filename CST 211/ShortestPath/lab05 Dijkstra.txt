Lab 6
Shortest Path

Description
Read the data file for Lab 5 and store it into the graph 
created for Assignment 11 (multi-list). 

The format for the file is:
Start Node,End Node,Path,Mileage

Write a program that allows the user to enter in any 
starting point and any ending point and your program 
will provide the shortest (distance) path to the desired destination. 
Show the path from the source to the destination as well as the 
estimated time to arrive at your destination (assume you go the 
speed limit and that I-5 is 65 mph while all other roads are 55 mph).

Remember, this is an algorithm that uses a graph. 
It is not (necessarily) a class and it is definitely 
not a part of or derived from the graph class.
